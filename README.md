**Bark Pawrks**

# Introduction:

The bark pawrks team created an IOS application that enables dog owners to find dog parks in their immediate area and leave reviews to better inform dog owners. Our team did not have any previous mobile development experience, so this served as an excellent learning experience using Swift and the IOS development environment. This experience was effective in building our confidence with a new development framework and working with a group to develop a cohesive project. As a team we also learned soft skills of learning how to collaborate together and build a development plan as a group. These skills will no doubt prove to be valuable in jobs in the future. After building this iOS app the team has learned to enjoy developing with swift and Xcode and plans to further develop these skills in the future.

# User Perspective:

From an end user perspective Bark Pawrks gives the ability to search for dog parks based on GPS location of the mobile device and also the zip code or city, if the user is not comfortable providing device location. Users will be able to see attributes of dog parks such as size, leash/no-leash, different areas for different sized-dogs, etc. Users are able to leave reviews and information of the attributes of the dog park so that other users will be more informed about the dog parks in their area. Target users will use this knowledge to find the appropriate parks to bring their dogs and will be more knowledgeable about dog parks in the area.

# Development Efforts:

We were able to complete all the features requested by the project sponsor and the app is functional. The main area where we deviated from our project plan was using storyboard ui vs swift ui. We had a minor issue where some members learned swift development using swift ui and one member used storyboard ui. We decided then to just use swift ui since that is easier to use and the more modern approach. We also changed our project structure from MVC to MVVM since swift ui works well with this pattern. We also initially planned to use google maps and google places api to pull park information. But as we researched, we learned that google api’s weren’t very accurate because they were only accurate for certain types of searches like restaurants and businesses. We then used yelp api which was very accurate because each search object is tagged with a type. There were features that were planned at the beginning of project planning that we were not able to implement. While planning the project we were not aware of the time that would be needed to implement a social aspect to the app and the filter option. These two features are not part of the project at this time. We are leaving the project open if any of the team would like to work on these features in the future to gain more experience.

# Software Libraries/ Framework:

-   Programming Language Swift
-   Yelp Location Api
-   Swift UI SDK
-   Firebase / Firestore
-   Development Environment: xcode
-   Postman for testing

# Conclusion:

The bark pawrks project has been an excellent project for our team to work on and grow as future software developers. We were able to take a set of requirements and turn that into a functioning application step by step. It was challenging at times coming up with the project plan, defining tasks and resolving issues with the ui frameworks. But we were able to quickly ramp up on iOS development and resolve all the issues that arose. There were some stretch goals that we missed like adding a chat feature but the app framework can accommodate that in the future.
